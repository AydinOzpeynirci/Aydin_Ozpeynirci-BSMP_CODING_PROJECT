Dear Wayland Community,

Based on the information provided, the water appears to be safe for swimming. 

The E.coli and Enterococci levels are within the acceptable limits (0 CFU/100mL), indicating that there is no bacterial contamination. The absence of pathogens further supports the safety of the water.

The pH level of 7.4 falls within the range of 6.5 to 8.5, which is considered safe for swimming.

Although there is no chlorine present, this is expected in a natural water body. Natural bodies of water usually do not have chlorine added, unlike treated pools. 

The absence of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations suggests that there is no excessive nutrient pollution, which can contribute to the growth of harmful algal blooms.

Additionally, the absence of pesticides and herbicides further indicates a low risk of contamination.

However, please note that water conditions can change rapidly, and it is always recommended to check for updated water quality advisories or consult local authorities for the most accurate and current information before swimming.

Sincerely,

Wayland Community Health Department
